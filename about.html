<hr>Everyone’s everyday life has been touched or disrupted since the first appearance of the current pandemic, COVID-19. The adjustments we make, the emotions we feel, and the actions we take will one day be the subject of historical studies. 
	<br><br>
In an effort to capture the lived experiences by members of the University of Southern California community, the USC Special Collections and University Archives invites you to create a record of your experience:  write a journal of your thoughts and experiences, record voice memos to make an audio journal, save your social media posts, or take photos and/or videos of life as you see it, or get creative with another format to document your life during this pandemic. 
	<br><br>
We are interested in stories about the shift to remote learning, being displaced from student housing, off-campus jobs, the ways you and your friends are staying in touch during this period of social distancing and self-quarantine, the challenges of international students or those with families abroad, the challenges of working away from campus, the disconnection from campus life, and so on.  
Journal writers may type or write by hand, transcribe news, draw or compose memes, compose poems, gather stories and so forth. You do not need to stress about “good grammar”, spelling, or style. We are interested in self-expression, candor and a willingness to be a social commentator.
	<br><br>
Events are changing by the day. They are specific to you, and to your families, friends, and communities. Please start documenting now! 
To participate, please fill out this form to help us gather your contact information. We are willing to accept both paper and digital submissions. For questions, please contact the USC Libraries Special Collections and University Archives. All submissions will be anonymous, unless you authorize us to publish your name.
