Special thanks to Nina Kin (http://www.ninakin.com) and Yoh Kawano (https://idre.ucla.edu/people/yoh-kawano) for help in creating this map/website. This site would not be possible without their work. Nina created the original repository which was used for an Arts Datathon track in 2019 (https://github.com/matikin9/arts-datathon-3-crafting). Yoh provided feedback on this latest iteration, adding a landing/modal page and a marker clustering option for map points. 

You can make your own version of this project:
*copy the repo
*update the scripts.js file to switch in your own google sheet IDs
*directions for how to get your [spreadsheet ID](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/general/databasing-google-spreadsheets-to-json)
*update the index.html for your own text

[Templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C97vt-nzDFczkEYfoe3y2Ga_5xKh6VUt) for the google form and corresponding sheet are available in this google drive. The sheet in particular has two scripts, one for geocoding and one for transfering the data from the form to the webmap. As it stands now you need to run the geocoding script yourself as well as move the data from one sheet to the other. This is more for ensuring an editorial process before having a story published immediately.

Please feel free to email arutkows at usc dot edu with any questions or ideas for improvement. This is a work in progress!
